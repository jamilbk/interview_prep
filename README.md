# Elixir Interview Prep

Common coding problems, implemented in Elixir.

Check [the lib directory](./lib) for all the problems.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `interview_prep` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:interview_prep, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/interview_prep](https://hexdocs.pm/interview_prep).

## Requirements

* Recent version of Elixir and OTP. 1.9 and above should work fine, perhaps
  even older.

## Running

All interview problems are implemented as ExUnit tests. Simply run the test
suite with `mix test` from the project root. Failing tests indicate incorrect
answers.
